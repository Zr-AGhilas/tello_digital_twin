# Data-Driven Digital Twin of a Tello Drone

> **ROS2 · Gazebo · LSTM Sequence Learning**

A modular framework that bridges physics-based simulation and data-driven state estimation by synchronizing a ROS2 kinematic model with a high-fidelity Gazebo environment — and training an LSTM network to capture residual non-linear dynamics.

## Overview

This repository implements a **Digital Twin** framework for the DJI Tello drone. The system pursues four core objectives:

| Objective | Description |
|---|---|
| **Baseline Twin** | Real-time ROS2 dynamics node that mirrors drone behavior using kinematic integration |
| **Data Acquisition** | Synchronized logging of control inputs (`Twist`) and ground-truth states |
| **Behavioral Analysis** | Trajectory comparison between the mathematical twin and Gazebo's physics engine |
| **State Prediction** | LSTM network trained to predict future states and model non-linear residuals |

---

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular ROS2 design where the Digital Twin and the Physical Entity (Gazebo) consume the same command stream simultaneously.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Kinematic Baseline

The twin node calculates state updates by integrating velocity commands over time. For a state vector $\mathbf{x} = [x, y, z, \psi]^T$ and input $\mathbf{u}$, the transition is:

$$x_{t+1} = x_t + \int_{t}^{t+\Delta t} f(x, u) \, dt$$

This baseline captures ideal rigid-body motion but does not model aerodynamic drag, motor latency, or inertial effects — gaps that the LSTM is trained to fill.

### 2. LSTM Sequence Modeling

To capture complex dynamics (drag, inertia, motor latency), an LSTM network is trained offline on logged data:

| Component | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Input** | Sliding window of the last $N$ commands and states |
| **Output** | Predicted state at $T + \Delta t$ |
| **Loss Function** | Mean Squared Error (MSE) vs. Gazebo ground truth |
| **Framework** | PyTorch or TensorFlow |

The LSTM learns to model the *residual* between the kinematic twin's prediction and the true physics-simulated trajectory.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Dependency | Recommended Version |
|---|---|
| ROS2 | Humble or Foxy |
| Gazebo | 11 |
| Python | 3.8+ |
| PyTorch / TensorFlow | Latest stable |
| `pandas`, `numpy` | Latest stable |

### Installation & Build

```bash
# 1. Create workspace
mkdir -p ~/tello_twin_ws/src
cd ~/tello_twin_ws/src

# 2. Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-link> .

# 3. Build
cd ~/tello_twin_ws
colcon build --symlink-install

# 4. Source the workspace
source install/setup.bash
```

### Running the System

**Terminal 1 — Launch Gazebo simulation:**
```bash
ros2 launch tello_description gazebo.launch.py
```

**Terminal 2 — Start the kinematic twin node:**
```bash
ros2 run tello_twin simple_dynamics
```

**Terminal 3 — Start the data logger:**
```bash
ros2 run tello_twin logger_node
```

**Terminal 4 — Send test commands:**
```bash
ros2 run tello_twin cmd_test
```

## Data Pipeline

The `logger_node` subscribes to both `/tello_state` and `/model_pose`, synchronizes them by timestamp, and writes a CSV file with the following schema:

```
timestamp | cmd_vx | cmd_vy | cmd_vz | cmd_yaw | twin_x | twin_y | twin_z | twin_yaw | gz_x | gz_y | gz_z | gz_yaw
```

Logs are written to `ml/data/` and consumed directly by the LSTM training script.

---

## LSTM Model

### Training

```bash
cd ml/
python train_lstm.py --data data/flight_log.csv --window 20 --epochs 100
```

### Evaluation

```bash
python evaluate.py --model models/lstm_best.pt --data data/flight_log.csv
```

The evaluation script generates trajectory comparison plots between:
- Gazebo ground truth
- Kinematic baseline twin
- LSTM-corrected prediction
